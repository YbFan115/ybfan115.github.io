# About Me (Yibin Fan)

I am an undergraduate student majoring in communication at Renmin University in China, Beijing.

My previous research was mostly intended to uncover the mechanisms of social change with the advance of Internet technology. For example, the proliferation of online communities, especially those featured by peer production, has shown the potential of a new digital public life. I would like to conduct the social scientific research by investigating online communities like Reddit and Wikipedia, and I hope my research could contribute to a sustainable progress towards a flourishing Internet.

To tackle issues relevant about technology and society, I use mostly quantitive and computational methods in my work. I also have some experiences in qualitative methods, including ethnographic fieldwork and archival study.
 
Now I am working as a research assistant in [Community Data Science Collective](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page), a research group focused on studying online communities. I help to build dataset which relates two online communities ([Fandom Wiki](fandom.com) and [Reddit](reddit.com)) in the project. Here are my [notes](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/2021/08/30/ra-notes/) about what skills and ideas I have got from this experience. More research experiences of mine can be found at the [Projects](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/projects/) or the [CV](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/cv/) page.

During my spare time, I like swimming, running, and listening to [Peking opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_opera), which is a historic art more than 200 years old!
