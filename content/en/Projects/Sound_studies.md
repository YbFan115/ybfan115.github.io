Abstract: This project was conducted during the directed reading workshop hosted by Prof. Wang at Renmin University on *STS studies*. It used archival study to link the emerging theoretical turn in STS - [sound studies](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_studies) and media history, and found that (1) the sound of ancient opera could contribute to shaping the embodied experience of audience; (2) various kinds of social relationships were mediated by the sound due to its features as a medium.

The full paper generated by the project is going to be presented on the 2021 Annual Convention of [JCA-China](http://www.jca-china.org/):
Wang, Y. & **Fan, Y.** (2021). Listening to Chinese Ancient Opera: Linking Media History and Sound Studies. Paper presented to the Annual Conference of the Chinese Association for History of Journalism and Communication. Shenzhen, China.
