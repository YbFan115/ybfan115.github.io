This project begins with my coursework on Communication Cognition, which is a graduate-level seminar given by [Prof. Yegiyan](https://communication.ucdavis.edu/people/nyegiyan) at UC Davis. I accomplished the research proposal on this seminar and am collecting data now. 

### Key Concepts
- *Self-control*: the mental processes which allow people to make their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors consistent with their long-term targets (Inzlicht, Schmeichel, & Macrae, 2014)
- *Two models for self-control*
	- Strength model of self-control (Baumeister et al., 2007)
	- **Motivational model of self-control** (Inzlicht, Schmeichel, & Macrae, 2014) : Capacity to override desire (motivational strength) to get pleasure in the environment
- *Multitask media use*: Using more than one kinds of media during a period of time. There are different types of multitasking, including concurrent multitasking, **task switching**, and sequential multitasking. (Borst, Taatgen, & Van Rijn, 2010)
- *Media use switch*: Task switching model (Gazzaley & Rosen, 2016)

- *Affective well-being*: As a ‘transient emotional change’ (i.e. well-being consists of feeling good and not feeling bad) (Huta, 2016).
	- Two ways to measure: By interview (Weinstein, 2018); **PANAS** (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) (Watson, Clark, & Carey, 1988)

- Research Question: How does young adults’ self-control in media multitasking influence their affective well-being?

### Hypotheses
- H1a: Young adults fail their self-control by switching from one media to another when they feel less motivated in the previous ‘have-to-do’ tasks.
- H1b: Young adults exert their self-control by switching from one media to another when they feel less motivated in the previous ‘want-to-do’ tasks.
- H2a: Self-control failure can improve the affective well-being of young adults.
- H2b: Self-control exertion can decrease the affective well-being of young adults.

### Methodology
- Experience Sampling Method
	- Participants will be asked to recall about what media multitasking behavior they have done, and fill in the following form three times a day during two weeks.
