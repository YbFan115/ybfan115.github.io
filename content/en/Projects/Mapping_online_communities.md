This project directed by Nate aims to map two online communities which are fandom wiki and reddit. By computational methods, we try to find out how associated the fandom wikis and subreddits are, to further find out the features of the intergroup relationship.

I am playing a role in building the dataset. Here are my [notes](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/2021/08/30/ra-notes/) about how we organize the data, and what skills and ideas I have got from the project.
