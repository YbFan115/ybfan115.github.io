- Abstract
	- >With single examples, we can not in general know how much of observed network structure is explained by historical accidents, random noise, or meaningful social processes, nor can we claim that network structure predicts outcomes, such as organization success or ecosystem health.
		- Notes: There are many questions which could not be explained by the current research on network structure in single examples, including whether the formation of the structure results from historical and political contigencies, or substantial social change processes; or how can network structure predict outcomes like organization success and ecosystem health.
	- >The comparative approach makes previously untested theories testable. 

- Why populations of networks?
	- Studying Populations of Online Organizations by Hill & Shaw
- community assembly
	- Ecological analogs: **composition** of the current community; **ordering effects**; **competition** within and between systems; and **natural limits** on growth (due to local and global resources)
	- Comparative approach, or multiple instances
- boundaries of sociotechnical systems 
	- ==set the inclusion criteria for a group of users==
