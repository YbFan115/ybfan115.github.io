>Starbird, K., & Wilson, T. (2020). Cross-platform disinformation campaigns: Lessons learned and next steps. Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review. https://doi.org/10.37016/mr-2020-002[https://doi.org/10.37016/mr-2020-002]

- Research Question:
 1. How do disinformation campaigns work ==across online platforms== to achieve their strategic goals?
 2. How do governments and other political entities support disinformation campaigns?

- Summary
    - Methods: mix-method approach to examine digital trace data
    - Mapping the structure of the Twitter conversation around White Helmets, identifying a *pro*-White Helmets cluster and an *anti*-White Helmets cluster.
    - Comparing activities of two clusters, especially how they leverage YouTube videos in their efforts.
    - Main Finding: 
 	  1. On Twitter, content challenging the White Helmets is more prevalent than supporting them.
 	  2. Influential users on both sides of the White Helmets Twitter conversation post links to videos, but the anti-White Helmets network is more effective in leveraging YouTube as a resource for their Twitter campaign.
