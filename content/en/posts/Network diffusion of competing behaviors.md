- Abstract 
	- tested three well-known factors of single behavior diffusion - network transitivity, adoption threshold, and connectedness of early adopters - apply to scenarios of competitive diffusion
	- simulation study
- Intro
	- Research question: when multiple orgs compete for behavioral adoption, which org would prevail?
	- One way to explain how behaviors got adopted is through understanding social networks.
