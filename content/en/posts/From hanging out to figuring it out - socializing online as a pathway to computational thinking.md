	- "participatory debugging" - collaborative technical troubleshooting
	- quali - analysis of user activity over time and identify three factors as social antecedents of participatory debugging: sustained community, identifiable problems, topic porousness which means conversations can span multiple topics.

	- Young people socialize online in these ways: chatting with offline friends, join interest-driven community.
	- ==from hanging out to figuring it out: *based on the particular aim, in the context of some topics*==
