I am Yibin, an undergraduate majoring in communication at Renmin University of China. This is my first blog.

I am interested in two research fields: organizational communication, especially the research of online communities, such as Wikipedia, FoSS, and so on; and STS studies, especially sound studies, which is an emerging topic these years.

I am going to apply for graduate schools later this year, so I am devoted in the preparation for my application. I am now preparing for the GRE test, assisting [Nate](https://teblunthuis.cc/) to build a dataset, and revising my paper which is going to be submitted to the annual conference held by [Chinese Association for History of Journalism and Communication](http://www.jca-china.org/).

Besides, I insist on reading papers relevant to my research interest, and I would like to share my notes, ideas, and comments for these outstanding and vital papers. Looking forward to communicating with you.
