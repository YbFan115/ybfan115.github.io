- Abstract
	- >Modular Politics would enable platform operators and their users to build **bottom-up governance processes** from computational components that are modular and composable, **highly versatile in their expressiveness**, **portable from one context to another**, and **interoperable across platforms**
	- ==another reason for study the relationship among platforms or communities==
- Intro
	-  (1) Modularity: Platform operators and community members should have the ability to construct systems by creating, importing, and arranging composable parts together as a coherent whole.
	- (2) Expressiveness: The governance layer should be able to implement as wide a range of processes as possible. 
	- (3) Portability: Governance tools developed for one platform should be portable to another platform for reuse and adaptation. 
	- (4) Interoperability: Governance systems operating on different platforms and protocols should have the ability to interact with each other, sharing data and influencing each otherâ€™s processes.
	- >at best, computational tools can facilitate those non-computational processes... adjudicate challenges in creative and diverse ways
