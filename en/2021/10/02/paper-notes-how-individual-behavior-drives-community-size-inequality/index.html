I am more interested in the latter, motivated by the key concern - how do people live their public life in the digital environment- since peer production was claimed &ldquo;radically decentralized, collaborative and nonproprietary&rdquo; (Benkeler).==</p><p>Delighted by the potential to better the public life of online communities featured by peer production, in a social scientific perspective, I would propose a research on how various kinds of characteristics of online communities emerge from the individual-level behaviors.</p><p>For the macro-micro link, the typical social scientific research focused on the structure which formed by the micro interaction, however, the processes through which individual behavior led to the macro structure have not been unmasked. Recent computational methods provide a way to make up this gap, especially agent-based simulation. The theory-data link is more relevant about the value of technology. How would technological change promote the public life? The classical political philosophers or theoristis have proposed images of a good public life, which cannot be approached without a</p><p style=color:#777>Last modified on 2021-10-02</p></div><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style=font-size:30px;color:#000></i></a></main><footer class=footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/center-img.js></script><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=/en/posts/index.xml type=application/rss+xml title="RSS feed">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ target=_blank>License
