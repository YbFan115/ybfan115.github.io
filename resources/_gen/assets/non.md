### Course 
I have taken interdisciplinary courses during my undergraduate learning at both [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu), which can be classified broadly into three categories: Theories, Research Methods, and Specific Topics. Look into the [Courses](https://ybfan115.github.io/en/courses/) page to know more about them.
